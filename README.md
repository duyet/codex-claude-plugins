## Quick Install

### Claude Code

Use Claude Code's plugin marketplace commands:

```bash
# Add marketplace
/plugin marketplace add duyet/codex-claude-plugins

# Install plugins
/plugin install team-agents@duyet-claude-plugins
/plugin install commit@duyet-claude-plugins
/plugin install frontend-design@duyet-claude-plugins
/plugin install interview@duyet-claude-plugins
/plugin install statusline@duyet-claude-plugins
/plugin install orchestration@duyet-claude-plugins
/plugin install duyetbot@duyet-claude-plugins
/plugin install docs-generator@duyet-claude-plugins
/plugin install github@duyet-claude-plugins
/plugin install fix@duyet-claude-plugins
/plugin install clickhouse-monitoring@duyet-claude-plugins
```

### Codex

Codex support is provided through the repo-local Codex marketplace file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/duyet/codex-claude-plugins.git
cd claude-plugins
```

Then add or import the local Codex marketplace from:

```text
.agents/plugins/marketplace.json
```

That marketplace points each plugin at the matching local folder, for example:

```json
{
  "name": "github",
  "source": {
    "source": "local",
    "path": "./github"
  }
}
```

After the marketplace is added in Codex, install the plugins you want from the `Duyet Claude and Codex Plugins` marketplace. Codex-facing workflow skills are available under each plugin's `skills/` folder, including wrappers for Claude command-heavy plugins such as `commit`, `github`, `fix`, `statusline`, `team-agents`, and `duyetbot`.

### Alternative: Skills CLI

Install via the open [Skills](https://skills.sh) ecosystem, works with Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, Windsurf, and [15+ other agents](https://skills.sh):

```bash
npx skills add duyet/codex-claude-plugins
```

### Codex Metadata

This repository also ships Codex plugin metadata in place:

- Each plugin has a `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` beside its Claude `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
- Codex marketplace entries live in `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`.
- Claude slash commands and agents stay in their original folders; Codex-facing wrapper skills live under `skills/*-workflow/SKILL.md` where a plugin needs a Codex entry point.

## Usage Examples

### Parallel Team Execution
```bash
# Delegate to team agents for parallel work
/duyetbot:spawn Implement the frontend dashboard
# Leader coordinates senior + junior engineers working in parallel
```

### Smart GitHub Workflow
```bash
# Automatically creates feature branch from main
/gh-pr create "Add user settings page"
# Detects main/master, creates feature/X branch, implements, creates PR
```

### PR Babysitting with /goal
```bash
# Set a persistent goal to babysit a PR — auto-fix CI, address reviews, wait for green
/goal /github:babysit-pr https://github.com/duyet/clickhouse-monitoring/pull/1355

# With auto-merge and CI fixing
/goal /github:babysit-pr --pr 1355 --auto-merge --fix-ci
```
